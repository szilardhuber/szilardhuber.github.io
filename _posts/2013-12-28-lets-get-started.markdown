After months (years?) of playing with the idea I finally got everything in place to start this blogging thing. My requirements were the following:

  - A decent (and <b>cheap / free</b>) Markdown editor with live preview mode.
  - Easily manageable Markdown-based static blogging engine.
  - Easy hosting

I came to the following solutions for my requirements:

  -  [LightPaper for Mac](http://clockworkengine.com/lightpaper-mac/) as the Markdown editor. Only using it for minutes now but already love it.
  -  [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com) just got some great docs and is an awesome static hosting platform.
  -  [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) is a promising blogging engine for Github pages but I have already tried installing it a few times and always failed to do so. (Although I have to admit I did not put much effort into it.)

The first two steps went like charm. I had the "Hello World" personal Github Page and had already started writing my first post in LightPaper. 
But for Jekyll I just run into the same problem as I did the last time:

``` bash
mbp@~/Developer/szilardhuber.github.io:(master)$ sudo gem install jekyll
Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing jekyll:
	ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

Gem files will remain installed in /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/fast-stemmer-1.0.2 for inspection.

```

Ok quick googling and came to the following StackOverflow answer [suggesting installing Xcode](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10725767/error-installing-jekyll-native-extension-build).

App Store starts to act weird as it seems like downloading Xcode but after some trying I figured out I had to manually click on the Update button in the Store despite it said it is being purchased right now. Ok now I remember this was where I gave up Jekyll the previous times. So Xcode is installed and I still remember that it is not enough to install it, you have to start it as well.

This time Jekyll installs successfully. 

Next step is creating a new post:

```bash
jekyll new . â€”force
```

I have the Jekyll boilerplate now. Let's just quickly copy the header from the sample post to this one, save this into the _posts folder, change the data in the header and push everyting up to github.
