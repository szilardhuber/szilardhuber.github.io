# Let's get started

After months (years?) of playing with the idea I finally got everything in place to start this blogging thing. My requirements were the following:

  - A decent (and <b>cheap / free</b>) Markdown editor with live preview mode.
  - Easily manageable Markdown-based static blogging engine.
  - Easy hosting

I came to the following solutions for my requirements:

  -  [LightPaper for Mac](http://clockworkengine.com/lightpaper-mac/) as the Markdown editor. Only using it for minutes now but already love it.
  -  [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com) just got some great docs and is an awesome static hosting platform.
  -  [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) is a promising blogging engine for Github pages but I have already tried installing it a few times and always failed to do so. (Although I have to admit I did not put much effort into it.)
